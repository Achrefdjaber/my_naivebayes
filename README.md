## 🧐 About
This project implements a Naïve Bayes classifier for continuous data using the Gaussian distribution. It is a simple and efficient approach for classification tasks where the features are assumed to be normally distributed.

### Why Naïve Bayes?
- **Simple and efficient**: Easy to implement and computationally efficient.
- **Works well with small datasets**: Effective even with limited data.
- **Assumes independence of features**: Uses conditional independence, making it suitable for high-dimensional data.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Supports continuous data using Gaussian distributions
- ✅ Calculates probabilities for each class using Bayes' theorem
- ✅ Lightweight and no external libraries required (except NumPy)
- ✅ Easy to modify and extend
