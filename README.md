🧐 About
This project implements a Naïve Bayes classifier for continuous data using the Gaussian distribution. It is a simple and efficient approach for classification tasks where the features are assumed to be normally distributed.

The classifier calculates the likelihood of an observation belonging to each class based on its features and assigns the class with the highest probability.

Why Naïve Bayes?
Simple and efficient: Easy to implement and computationally efficient.
Works well with small datasets: Effective even with limited data.
Assumes independence of features: Uses conditional independence, making it suitable for high-dimensional data.
✨ Features
✅ Supports continuous data using Gaussian distributions
✅ Calculates probabilities for each class using Bayes' theorem
✅ Lightweight and no external libraries required
✅ Easy to modify and extend
🛠️ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it here.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naive-bayes-continues.git
cd naive-bayes-continues
Install dependencies (if required):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: This project does not use any external libraries except for numpy.

🚀 Usage
Here’s how you can use the Naïve Bayes classifier:

Import the functions
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from classifier import NB_continues, px
Training and Predicting
python
Copy code
# Sample training data
X = np.array([[5.1, 3.5], [4.9, 3.0], [6.2, 2.8], [5.5, 2.4]])
Y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])

# New observation to classify
x = np.array([5.4, 3.1])

# Predict the class
predicted_class, probabilities = NB_continues(X, Y, x)
print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
print(f"Class Probabilities: {probabilities}")
Output
vbnet
Copy code
Predicted Class: 0
Class Probabilities: [0.0023 0.0015]
⚙️ How It Works
Training Phase:

Calculates the mean and standard deviation for each attribute per class.
Computes the prior probabilities for each class.
Prediction Phase:

For a given observation x, calculates the likelihood using the Gaussian formula:
𝑃

𝑥

𝑢

𝑠
)
=

Uses the Naïve Bayes formula to compute the posterior probability for each class:
𝑃
(

∣
𝑥
)
∝
𝑃

)

𝑃
(

)
P(class∣x)∝P(x∣class)×P(class)
Predicts the class with the highest posterior probability.
